# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw"></i> About me #
I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon. I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), where I was fortunate to be coadvised by [Prof. Qifan Song](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~qfsong/) and [Prof. Jean Honorio](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jhonorio/). 
I also received an M.S. in Computer Science and Statistics during my Ph.D. study. 
I received a B.Sc. in Mathematics from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).
I have interned at several companies including [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com), [Amazon Ads](https://advertising.amazon.com/), and [Sensetime Research](https://www.sensetime.com/en).

My research interests include:

* Optimization Theory
* Bandit Algorithms
* Federated Learning
* High Dimensional Statistics
* Deep Learning Theory and Practice

_Research collaborations from both industry and academia are highly welcomed. If you are interested in optimization/bandit/federated learning-related topics, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto: liwj@amazon.com)._
